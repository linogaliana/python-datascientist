## Exercise 1: Group Aggregations

1. Calculate the total emissions of the "Residential" sector by department and compare the value to the most polluting department in this sector. Draw insights from the reality that this statistic reflects.

2. Calculate the total emissions for each sector in each department. For each department, calculate the proportion of total emissions coming from each sector.
