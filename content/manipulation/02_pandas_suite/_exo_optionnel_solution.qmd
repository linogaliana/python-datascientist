### The NIR and the issue of individual identifiers' confidentiality

For individuals, there exists a unique identifier that allows linking them across different data sources: the [NIR](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/definition/nir-numero-dinscription-au-repertoire), also known as the INSEE number or social security number.
This number is necessary for the administration to manage social benefits (health, retirement, family...). Beyond this function, which can be useful daily, this number is a unique individual identifier in the [National Register of Physical Persons (RNIPP)](https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/definition/c1602).

This identifier is mainly present in management databases related to payroll, social benefits, etc. However, unlike the Sirene number, it contains several sensitive pieces of information and is inherently linked to the sensitive issue of social security rights.

![Social security number (Source: [Améli](https://www.ameli.fr/assure/droits-demarches/principes/numero-securite-sociale))](https://www.ameli.fr/sites/default/files/styles/webp_ckeditor/public/thumbnails/image/infographie_assures-regle-identification-assures.gif.webp?itok=j2owVDrB){fig-width="80%"}

To address this problem, the [non-significant statistical code (CSNS)](https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/7635825?sommaire=7635842) or hashed NIR, a non-identifying anonymous individual identifier, was recently implemented. The goal of this anonymized identifier is to reduce the dissemination of personal information that, although allowing civil servants and researchers to deterministically link numerous databases, provided analysts with non-essential information about the individuals in question.

[^flou]: Otherwise, we enter the realm of fuzzy matching or probabilistic matching. Fuzzy matching occurs when we no longer have an exact identifier to link two databases but have partially noisy information between two sources to make the connection. For example, in a product database, we might have `Coca Cola 33CL` and in another `Coca Cola canette`, but these names hide the same product. The chapter on [Introduction to Textual Search with ElasticSearch](/content/modern-ds/elastic.qmd) addresses this issue. Probabilistic matching is another approach. In these, observations in two databases are associated not based on an identifier but on the distance between a set of characteristics in both databases. This technique is widely used in medical statistics or in the evaluation of public policies based on [_propensity score matching_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching).
