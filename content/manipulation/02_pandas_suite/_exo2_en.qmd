## Exercice 2: Restructuring Data: Wide to Long

1. Create a copy of the ADEME data by doing `df_wide = emissions.copy()`

2. Restructure the data into the *long* format to have emission data by sector while keeping the commune as the level of analysis (pay attention to other identifying variables).

3. Sum the emissions by sector and represent it graphically.

4. For each department, identify the most polluting sector.
