## Exercise 1: Using the DVF API

1. Search for all existing transactions in DVF at Plogoff (municipality code `29168`, in Brittany).
Display the keys of the JSON and deduce the number of recorded transactions.
2. Display only the transactions concerning houses.
3. Use the [API geo](https://api.gouv.fr/documentation/api-geo) to retrieve the municipal boundaries of the city of Plogoff.
4. Plot the histogram of sales prices.

Feel free to go further by playing with group variables, for example.
