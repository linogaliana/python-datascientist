## Exercise 3

Given

```python
x = np.random.normal(size=10000)
```

1. Keep only the values whose absolute value is greater than 1.96
2. Count the number of values greater than 1.96 in absolute value and their proportion in the whole set
3. Sum the absolute values of all observations greater (in absolute value) than 1.96 and relate them to the sum of the values of `x` (in absolute value)
