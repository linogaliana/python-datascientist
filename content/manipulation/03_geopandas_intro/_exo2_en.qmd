## Exercise 2: Projections, representations, and approximations

1. Experiment with representing the borders of France using several projections:

- Mercator WGS84 (EPSG: 4326)
- Healpix projection (`+proj=healpix +lon_0=0 +a=1`)
- Projection for Tahiti (EPSG: 3304)
- Albers projection for the United States (EPSG: 5070)

2. Calculate the area in $km^2$ of the French regions in the following two projection systems:
World Mercator WGS84 (EPSG: 3395) and Lambert 93 (EPSG: 2154). Calculate the difference in $km^2$ for each region.
