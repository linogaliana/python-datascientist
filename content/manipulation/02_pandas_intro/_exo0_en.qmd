## Preliminary Exercise: Importing a CSV (Optional)

1. Use the code above ☝️ to download the data. Use `Pandas` to read the downloaded file.
2. Find where the data was written. Observe the structure of this directory.
3. Create a new folder using the file explorer (on the left in `Jupyter` or `VSCode`). Move the CSV and the notebook. Restart the kernel and adjust your code if needed. Repeat this process several times with different folders. What issues might you encounter?
