## Exercise 5 (optional): Coverage map of the stations

This exercise is more complex because it involves going back to `Shapely`, a lower-level library than `GeoPandas`.

This exercise is left open-ended. A possible source of inspiration is this discussion on [StackExchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/337561/making-polygon-for-every-point-in-set-using-voronoi-diagram).

The objective is to make two coverage maps: one at the level of the petite couronne and the other only within Paris intramuros.
