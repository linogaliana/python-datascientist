All content on this website is contributory and can be collaboratively improved according to your skills and preferences. __Thank you very much if you are ready to contribute to the enhancement of the site!__

The purpose of this `CONTRIBUTING` guide is to direct anyone interested in suggesting content to the most appropriate method. This document will mainly outline the process for substantial content proposals, which require guidance because they demand an understanding of the site's workings. 

However, for small suggestions, it is recommended to go directly through the `GitHub` interface: it's not necessary to understand the (complex) functioning of the site to point out a dead link, correct a typo, or fix a reference to a non-existent figure!

> [!NOTE]
> This `CONTRIBUTING` guide should not be intimidating; on the contrary, its goal is to assist users who wish to make more substantial modifications by showing them that the site's functioning is not as daunting as it seems.

> [!CAUTION]
> For substantial modifications, it is recommended to test them using a file editor like `VSCode`. This is explained below.
> 
> These suggested modifications should be made via a branch, as will be indicated. For more minor changes, such as correcting typos, it's likely easier to use the `GitHub` interface, which will handle branch creation for you.

## What type of contribution?

Modification suggestions can mainly be made in two ways:

* _[discussions](https://github.com/linogaliana/python-datascientist/discussions)_ allow you to point out an issue or discuss content improvements. If you are not comfortable with editing content on `GitHub`, this is the easiest way to start. I may transfer the discussion to an [_issue_](https://github.com/linogaliana/python-datascientist/issues) to keep a record of it in my modification plan.
* [_pull requests_](https://github.com/linogaliana/python-datascientist/pulls) allow you to directly suggest an update to a file.
    + For minor text changes, such as a typo, you can do this directly using the `Edit` button on `GitHub`.
    + For more substantial content modifications, before making a large _pull request_, feel free to open an [_issue_](https://github.com/linogaliana/python-datascientist/issues) to discuss the modification you want to implement.

The rest of this guide assumes you are in the latter scenario, i.e., making a substantial content modification that has been discussed in an [_issue_](https://github.com/linogaliana/python-datascientist/issues). The purpose of the rest of this guide is to provide you with all the necessary information to understand the repository's logic.

## Repository Functioning

### Principle

The website and notebooks are built using [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/). `Python` resources provided through this `GitHub` repository are of two types:

* The website [pythonds.linogaliana.fr/](https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr/) is the main content produced from this repository. It is the html _output_ constructed by `Quarto` (see below);
* The _notebooks_ offer the same textual content with executable code in a `Jupyter` or `VSCode` environment of your choice. They are the ipynb _output_ constructed by `Quarto` (see below). This is important because the _notebook_ is not, as is often the case, the source file but a production from another source of truth: therefore, it is not on the _notebooks_ that you can make your modification suggestions.

Bilingual content is managed through `Quarto` [_profiles_](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html). Therefore, bilingual files have many tags like `::: {.content-visible when-profile="en"}` or `::: {.content-visible when-profile="fr"}` to manage the content displayed in the English or French versions. This choice limits code redundancy while providing adaptive content for the web version reader (for the _notebook_ version, only the chosen language is displayed, but the French and English versions coexist).

### Repository Architecture

The repository is structured as a `Quarto` project. Its behavior is controlled by the `_quarto*.yml` files at the root. Currently, there are 4 such files, which can be grouped into two categories:

* `_quarto.yml` and `_quarto-prod.yml` are the files that define the overall behavior of `Quarto`.
    + The first is useful for testing during the development phase as it does not run all chapters, only those defined within it. This is the one you will modify if you want to test substantial modifications to a chapter.
    + The second is used during the full site build phase in continuous integration (see below). Unless you want to change the behavior of the website, it should not be modified.
* `_quarto-fr.yml` and `_quarto-en.yml` manage the settings for the French and English versions, in addition to the global settings explained earlier. By default, only the French version is built. The script `build/preview_all.sh`, which we will return to, illustrates how to build a multilingual version of the website.

The main folders 📁 of the repository are:

* `content/`: the source files for the website (in addition to the `index.qmd` homepage);
* `build/`: scripts useful for continuous integration or to override parameters for certain chapters;
* `dev-scripts/`: scripts useful for local site development during the testing phase;
* `.github/` and `docker/`: scripts useful for continuous integration (creating the reproducibility environment with the `Docker` image, using it in `GitHub` actions to build the site and test the _notebooks_).

## Website Preview

> [!TIP]
> Previewing requires a `Quarto` runtime environment with `Python`. Public officials, students, and researchers can benefit from such an environment for free through the [`SSPCloud`](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/?lang=fr) infrastructure developed by Insee. This will be much more flexible and powerful than Google Colab. If you do not fall into these categories of users, it is recommended to install [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

### Ready-to-use development environment for `SSPCloud` users

For `SSPCloud` users, here is the environment I use to develop my materials:

<a href="https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=python%20ENSAE&version=1.11.39&autoLaunch=false&kubernetes.role=«admin»&networking.user.enabled=true&git.cache=«36000»&git.repository=«https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flinogaliana%2Fpython-datascientist.git»&init.personalInit=«https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinogaliana%2Finit-scripts%2Fmain%2Finstall-copilot.sh»" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SSPcloud-Tester%20via%20SSP--cloud-informational&amp;color=yellow?logo=Python" alt="Onyxia"></a><br>

### Preliminary Steps

1️⃣ Change branch

```python
cd python-datascientist
git checkout -b suggestion #or another name if this branch already exists
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This branch change is not essential for a first modification suggestion but will be useful later to avoid version conflicts if there have been changes to the material in the meantime.

2️⃣ Install the packages used in the course

This course aims to stay up-to-date with current versions of `Python` and _data science_ libraries. Therefore, it is recommended to use a recent version of `Python` (at least 3.9 as of August 2024).

To install all the dependencies needed to build the website, you can run:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There will likely be many more packages than needed to develop one or two chapters, but at least you'll have everything you need.

## Modify a File

The content of a chapter can be modified in any text editor. However, I recommend using `VSCode`, which is the editor that best supports `Quarto` and offers the most useful features for `Python`.

> [!NOTE]
> To modify text only, it is not necessary to test the `Python` examples as indicated in the next section. However, if the chapter is bilingual, and the suggested modification is more than just a typo, it is appreciated if you also modify the English version to avoid inconsistencies between the texts in the different versions. To make this work less tedious, below is the _prompt_ I give to `ChatGPT` to get the proper formatting within the `::: {.content-visible when-profile="en"}` or `::: {.content-visible when-profile="fr"}` tags.
> 
> This is not mandatory and should not discourage you from suggesting modifications. If a translation is needed, I will implement it, but if you are feeling generous, it will save me some time 😉.

> I am going to give you French content as raw markdown (copy-pasted from a .qmd file). I want you to translate that content into English but there will be a series of important rules.
> 
> - You should put the translation into pandoc divs (see example below).
> - You should not change the Python chunks (
> {python} ...
> ) when you see one
> - To avoid markdown formatting in the UI, you are going to put everything between ~~~
> - You don't change the French text, you just put it inside the relevant pandoc div.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> # Contenu français
> 
> Ceci est du contenu français
> 
> {python}
> import numpy as np
> 
> ```
> 
> I want an answer like this:
> 
> ```
> ::: {.content-visible when-profile="fr"}
> # Contenu français
> 
> Ceci est du contenu français
> 
> {python}
> import numpy as np
> 
> :::
> ```
> 
> ::: {.content-visible when-profile="en"}
> 
> # English content
> 
> This is English content
> 
> {python}
> import numpy as np
> 
> :::
> 
> ```

## Testing Modifications

Let's assume you have made modifications to a file and you want to test them.

### Preview the appearance on the website

- [ ] Update `_quarto.yml` (do not touch `_quarto-prod.yml`) to include your file in the `render` list;
- [ ] Run the `/build/preview_all.sh` script in the command line, which includes the following lines:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
quarto render --profile fr --to html
quarto render --profile en --to html
cd _site/
python3 -m http.server -b 0.0.0.0 5000
```

which will:

1. Install the dependencies (if not already done);
2. Build the site, in both French and English;
3. Launch a local server to preview the website:
    + If you are using the `SSPCloud` environment (as suggested above if you are eligible), the `README` of your project includes a link that allows you to see your website and navigate it (see the screenshot below).
    + If you are in a local environment, the site should be accessible via https://0.0.0.0:5000.

_Access the previewed content for SSPCloud users_:

### Verify that the notebook works

- [ ] Run the `/build/preview_notebook.sh` script in the command line with your file name as the argument. For example:

```python
./dev-scripts/preview_notebook.sh content/manipulation/01_numpy.qmd
```

This test is an automated one; it only checks that the code in the notebook runs correctly. If you want to see what the notebook that will be made available looks like after the modification is validated, you can open the `toto.ipynb` file and review it.
